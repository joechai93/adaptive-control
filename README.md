# Adaptive Control
A collection of MATLAB scripts from my postgraduate studies and research. None of these are earth-shatteringly novel. They are just implementations of existing adaptive control techniques. These scripts are intended to assist fellow researchers and postgrad students in the field of adaptive control. Some of the control algorithms in this repo include:

- model identification methods using least squares
- model reference adaptive control (direct and indirect)
- robust adaptive control methods
    - demonstration of parameter drift
    - Rohr's canonical example of MRAC instability from unmodelled dynamics
    - demonstration of time delay margin in MRAC
    - L1 adaptive control
